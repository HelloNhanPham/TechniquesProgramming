Given two strings, compare the strings using pointers 

Examples:

Input: str1 = geeks, str2 = geeks
Output: Both are equal

Input: str1 = hello, str2 = hellu
Output: Both are not equal
As their length are same but characters are different
The idea is to dereference given pointers, compare values and advance both of them.
