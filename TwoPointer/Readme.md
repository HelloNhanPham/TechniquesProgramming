Two pointers is really an easy and effective technique which is typically used for searching pairs in a sorted array.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The "two-pointer" technique is a commonly used strategy in computer science and programming. It involves using two pointers to traverse a data structure or sequence in a way that helps solve a problem more efficiently. The two pointers can move at different speeds or in different directions, depending on the problem requirements.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here are some common scenarios where the two-pointer technique is applied:

1. Finding a pair in a sorted array:
If you have a sorted array, you can use two pointers to efficiently find a pair of elements that meet certain conditions. One pointer starts at the beginning, and the other starts at the end. Depending on the comparison of the sum or other conditions, you move the pointers towards each other.

2. Checking for duplicates in an array:
In a sorted or even an unsorted array, two pointers can be used to check for duplicate elements. One pointer iterates through the array, while the other keeps track of the current unique element. If the current element is not a duplicate, the second pointer is updated.

3. Finding a subarray with a given sum:
If you're looking for a subarray with a specific sum, two pointers can be used to slide through the array. You adjust the pointers based on whether the current sum is greater or less than the target sum.

4. Merging two sorted arrays:
Two pointers can be used to merge two sorted arrays efficiently. You compare elements at the current positions of the two pointers and insert the smaller one into a new array, updating the pointers accordingly.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The key idea is that the two pointers represent different positions in the data structure, and their movement is guided by the problem requirements. This technique is often used to optimize time complexity and achieve linear or near-linear time solutions for certain problems.
